			<h1> How to brew your own beer using the All-Grain Brew-in-a-bag method (BIAB) </h1>
			
			<h3> Pre-brew day and day of the brew</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Choose which beer you want to brew
						<ul>
							<li>Note: You can choose an Extract kit, All-Grain kit, or build your own recipe. This guide will use the All-Grain (BIAB) method and a 5 gallon batch</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>After you've picked your recipe, you'll have to gather the ingredients
						<ol type="a">
							<li>This will vary by recipe but will include grains, yeast, and hops (Note: You may need dry or liquid malt if doing an extract kit)</li>
							<li>Depending on your source of water, you may also want to consider purchasing filtered water from a store</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>After you've gathered your recipe materials, you'll need to get the following equipment
						<ol type="a">
							<li>Propane tank</li>
							<li>Propane burner</li>
							<li>20 gallon kettle with lid</li>
							<li>Wort chiller or large tub to create an ice bath</li>
							<li>Large spoon or paddle</li>
							<li>BIAB (Actual bag the grains will go in)</li>
							<li>Fermenter</li>
							<li>Bung and airlock</li>
							<li>Thermometer</li>
							<li>Thermo-gloves</li>
							<li>PBW cleaner</li>
							<li>Star San sanitizer</li>
							<li>Optional: Insulating materials</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Clean all your equipment using PBW cleaner
					<li>Sanitize the following equipment (Note: some equipment used for the boil won't need to be sanitized because the temperature of the boil will do that automatically)
						<ol type="a">
							<li>Wort Chiller</li>
							<li>Fermenter</li>
							<li>Bung and airlock</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>After you've gathered your equipment, you will want to use this <a href="calculator.html">Calculator</a> to calculate the amount of water you'll need
						<ul>
							<li>Note: If you're purchasing your water from a store, you will want to do this earlier</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Add the desired amount of water to your kettle and bring the temperature up to the strike point
						<ul>
							<li>Note: The strike point can be gotten from the <a href="calculator.html">Calculator</a> as well and is based off of many different factors that you fill out</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Once the water reaches the strike point you will add your BIAB to the kettle and then add your grains to the bag slowly as to not create any pockets of dry grain</li>
					<li>Once all the grains are in the bag, and the bag is tied shut, use your paddle or spoon to gently stir the bag so all the grains have gotten wet</li>
					<li>Turn off the heat source, cover the kettle, and let the grains steep for approximately 60 minutes at the Rest temperature (on the recipe instructions). (This may vary by recipe)
						<ul>
							<li>Note: If you are brewing on a particular cold day, you may need to insulate the kettle to help keep the grains and water warm</li>
						</ul>   
					</li>
					<li>Check on the temperature periodically, make sure that if the temperature gets lower than the Rest temperature, you turn the heat back on to keep the temperature close
						<ul>
							<li>Note: Don't leave the heat on to long and be careful that the BIAB doesn't get burned to the bottom</li>
						</ul>   
					</li>
					<li>Once the 60-minute rest is done, you will want to squeeze as much of the moisture out of the BIAB using the Thermo-gloves
						<ul>
							<li>Note: You may need to have someone else hold the bag while you squeeze. Otherwise, hang the bag from a secure hook above the kettle</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Once you've squeezed as much moisture from the BIAB as possible, dispose of the grains but keep the bag for next time</li>
					<li>You now have what is called the wort</li>
					<li>Bring your wort to a boil</li>
					<li>After your wort is boiling, you will have hop additions that will vary by recipe. Follow the directions per the recipe you are using. You will boil for 60 minutes</li>
					<li>After the boil is done, you want to cool your wort as fast as possible in order to prevent infection and bacteria growth</li>
					<li>Cool your wort using a wort chiller or ice bath. Bring it down to the temperature that you want to pitch your yeast at (varies by recipe)</li>
					<li>Slowly dump the cooled wort into your fermenter</li>
					<li>Add the yeast to the wort</li>
					<li>Boil some water to add to the airlock, then place the airlock and bung onto the top of the fermenter to seal it</li>
					<li>Now, you wait. Depending on the recipe, you could wait anytime between 2 and 6 weeks. You may also have to add dry hops depending on the recipe</li>
					<li>Congratulations! You've just brewed your own beer</li>
				</ol>

			<h3> Bottling Day</h3>
				<ol>
					<li> Gather the following equipment. You MUST clean and sterilize all of it
						<ol type="a">
							<li>PBW cleaner</li>
							<li>Star San sanitizer</li>
							<li>48 bottles</li>
							<li>48 unused bottle caps</li>
							<li>Capper</li>
							<li>Large spoon or paddle</li>
							<li>5 oz. corn sugar</li>
							<li>Syphon</li>
							<li>Optional: Bottle filler</li>
							<li>Bucket</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>With a 5 gallon batch, add 2 oz of corn sugar and 2 cups of water to a kettle on your stovetop</li>
					<li>Stir the sugar into the water until it's dissolved. Boil it for 10 minutes</li>
					<li>After you're done boiling the water, put it in your fridge to let it cool down</li>
					<li>Transfer the beer from the fermenter to a bucket large enough to hold all of the beer using a syphon
						<ul>
							<li>Note: Be careful not to get all the sediment that is at the bottom of the fermenter</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Once all the beer is in the bucket, add in the water and corn sugar mixture you have in the fridge and stir it for about a minute</li>
					<li>You will then use the syphon and optional bottle filler to fill the bottles</li>
					<li>Cap each bottle of beer as you're filling them</li>
					<li>Once you're done filling all of the bottles, store the beer in a cool dark place</li>
					<li>Your beer will be ready to drink in 1-2 weeks
						<ul>
							<li>Note: It takes that long for the yeast to eat the corn sugar and carbonate the beer</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ol>
